### I am a Machine Learning and Programming Languages researcher working as a Research Scientist in the [Ads Ranking team at Facebook](https://research.fb.com/people/singh-rohit/) where I am working on developing large scale machine learning technologies behind Facebook’s advertising marketplace.
### I graduated with a PhD from [Prof. Armando Solar-Lezama's](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/) [Computer-Aided Programming](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cap/) group at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) in 2017.  I am currently working on applications of various AI techniques along with the [Pyro programming language](http://pyro.ai) across product teams at Uber. My previous work has involved applications of Machine Learning, Quantitative Game Theory and Program Synthesis in multiple domains from the fields of Compilers and Databases. I have worked as an intern at Google where I used Google Brain's deep-learning framework for an application with the YouTube team and as a PM intern at Yelp where I worked on a Machine Learning application on Ad CTR prediction.
