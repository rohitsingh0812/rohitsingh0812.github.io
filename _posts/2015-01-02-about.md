### I am a Machine Learning and Programming Languages researcher working as a Research Scientist at Uber AI Labs.
### I graduated with a PhD from MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL) in 2017. I am currently working on applications of various AI techniques with the Pyro programming language across product teams at Uber. My previous work has involved applications of Machine Learning, Quantitative Game Theory and Program Synthesis in multiple domains from the fields of Compilers and Databases. I have worked as an intern at Google where I used the Google Brain deep-learning framework for an application with the YouTube team and as a PM intern at Yelp where I worked on a Machine Learning application on Ad CTR prediction.
